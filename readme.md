OpenRhythm currently depends on the following libs:
* CMake
* SDL2
* Freetype - I may switch to using stb_freetype haven't decided quite yet.
* GLM
* STB (included in extern/stb)
* Gettext

### Submodules
This project contains submodules. There are two ways to handle this.

To clone the repo and all submodules do:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/OpenRhythm/OpenRhythm
```

Otherwise if you have just cloned the repo you will need to run these to clone the submodules:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Compiling and packaging
You will need a compiler that supports C++14

* Makedepends : dependencies for compiling but not for executing :
    - CMake (3.0 minimum)
    - GLM   (Graphics, header only)

* Dependencies : for compiling and executing :
    - Freetype2
    - Gettext
    - OggVorbis
    - SDL2
    - cubeb

The following instructions are using "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017"
