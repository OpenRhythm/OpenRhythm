## TODO

### Priority Engine items.
* Setup a way to enable optional opengl extensions for potentially better performance.
* Text rendering support using either freetype, or stb_truetype.
* Audio playback with cubeb.
* OGG/Vorbis file loader with either libogg/libvorbis or stb_vorbis.
* A configuration file system
* Basic way of making a UI.



### The want list.
* Maybe add support for midi writing?
* Sound pitchshift/timewarp support with libsoundtouch.
* Advanced UI that could be used to build in-game score meters, and fancy stuff.
